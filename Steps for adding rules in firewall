I proceeded with the GUI interface of Windows Firewall.
I used Windows Defender Firewall with advanced Security to learn Firewall Rules and add new rules 

Steps that I proceeded to make a rule that blocks brave for getting me tcp packets 

->In run dialog box "wf.msc" run it then windows defender firewall with advanced security opens up
->I Select outbound Rule 
->On the right panel I clicked newrule
->A window named New Outbound Rule wizard appears 
->On the rule type I selected Custom
->On the program section I gave the braves program path in my PC:%ProgramFiles%\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application\brave.exe
->On the protocol type I selected TCP
->On the actions section I seleck block
->I set all other default
->And I gave it a name
->After that I ran a brave browser search that ended up in an error showing blocked by firewall

***After all from this task I understood what is firewall,How it works,And I eventually got all the answers for the interview questions that was given in the PDF
